    .. note-warning::

        Please note that these projects may have different licensing terms,
        different release schedule and generally different workflows. The
        projects might get out of sync with Magnum APIs or become abandoned ---
        we claim no responsibility. Contact the respective authors (or better,
        send them pull requests) if you encounter a problem. However, it's
        possible that particular projects will get integrated into Magnum
        itself at some point.

    .. block-success:: Do you have something?

        The above list is not exhaustive --- have you created a Magnum addon
        and would like to have it listed here? Ping us at info@magnum.graphics,
        we'll gladly mention it. Note that some widely-used projects that used
        to be listed here have since become an officially supported part of
        Magnum --- see for example the :dox:`GlmIntegration` and the
        :dox:`ImGuiIntegration` libraries.
