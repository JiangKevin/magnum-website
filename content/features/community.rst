On top of everything else, there are libraries, tools and concepts built by the
community --- not part of Magnum itself, but worth mentioning nevertheless.

.. note-warning::

    Please note that these projects may have different licensing terms,
    different release schedule and generally different workflows. The projects
    might get out of sync with Magnum APIs or become abandoned --- we claim no
    responsibility. Contact the respective authors (or better, send them pull
    requests) if you encounter a problem.

It's possible that particular projects will get integrated into Magnum itself
at some point.
