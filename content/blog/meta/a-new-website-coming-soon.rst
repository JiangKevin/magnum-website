:summary: Welcome to a prototype of the brand new Magnum website and blog! It
    still has quite a few rough edges, so please be careful, but from now on
    this is the new official place for blog posts and announcements.

The reason I decided to make the website public even though it's not fully
ready yet is that I desperately needed some official space for putting
feature announcements and blog posts. The old website infrastructure already
showed its age and authoring an article for it was a matter of *days* due to
technical debt of the PHP code originating back in 2004 (I feel old now).

The only thing that's here now is the content from the old website, copied over
verbatim for archival reasons. In the next weeks I will go over everything and
put up some actually up-to-date information and visual identity everywhere.

From now on, source of this website will be available
:gh:`on GitHub <mosra/magnum-website>`. It's powered by Pelican and
:gh:`m.css <mosra/m.css>` (for which I still need to write documentation). This
all means that everyone is now very welcome to contribute to the website ---
fixing up outdated content, writing guest posts and so on. More on that later.

Until next time!
