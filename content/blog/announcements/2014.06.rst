:summary: The Magnum C++11 and OpenGL/OpenGL ES/WebGL graphics engine gained
    experimental Android support, windowless applications on OS X and Windows,
    uses SDL2 as the default toolkit, adds new texture and mesh features,
    improves build system and got huge documentation review.

.. note-success:: Content care: May 06, 2018

    With the 2018.02 release the versioning scheme and tag naming changed from
    "Month Year snapshot" and ``snapshot-YYYY-MM`` to simply "YYYY.MM" and
    ``vYYYY.MM``. All tags and links in the article were updated to follow the
    new scheme, except for tags in the compatibility branch, which are kept in
    their original form for archival purposes.

    Detailed changelogs are now part of the documentation. Code snippets are
    kept in the original form for archival purposes.

The version 2014.06 is available under the ``v2014.06`` tag in
:gh:`Corrade <mosra/corrade^v2014.06>`, :gh:`Magnum <mosra/magnum^v2014.06>`,
:gh:`Magnum Plugins <mosra/magnum-plugins^v2014.06>` and
:gh:`Magnum Integration <mosra/magnum-integration^v2014.06>` GitHub
repositories. This article will describe the most important changes, for
detailed list follow the changelog links at the end of this announcement.

For compatibility branch there is the ``snapshot-2014-06-compatibility`` tag in
:gh:`Corrade <mosra/corrade^snapshot-2014-06-compatibility>`,
:gh:`Magnum <mosra/magnum^snapshot-2014-06-compatibility>`,
:gh:`Magnum Plugins <mosra/magnum-plugins^snapshot-2014-06-compatibility>` and
:gh:`Magnum Examples <mosra/magnum-examples^snapshot-2014-06-compatibility>`
repositories.

`Experimental Android support`_
===============================

This snapshot contains experimental support for Android, see
:dox:`Corrade <building-corrade-cross-android>` and :dox:`Magnum <building-cross-android>`
building documentation. Initial platform support is in :dox:`Platform::AndroidApplication`.

`Windowless applications on Mac OS X and Windows`_
==================================================

Windowless applications are now supported on Windows and, thanks to joint
effort by :gh:`amaranth` and :gh:`ArEnSc`, also on OS X. All command-line
utilities such as :dox:`magnum-info <magnum-gl-info>`,
:dox:`magnum-distancefieldconverter` and :dox:`magnum-fontconverter` are thus
now available on all three major platforms.

`Dropping GCC 4.6 support from master`_
=======================================

Since GCC 4.7 is available even in LTS Ubuntu, it was time to drop support for
4.6 from ``master`` and providing it only in ``compatibility`` branch. Master
branch now makes use of additonal C++11 features, such as template aliases,
delegating constructors, user-defined literals etc., resulting in more
maintainable code.

`Using SDL2 as the default windowing toolkit`_
==============================================

Since LTS Ubuntu now also has SDL2 in the repositories, it is now used in the
documentation, tutorials and examples as the default windowing toolkit. The
GLUT toolkit, which was used before, is still available in the library, but its
usage is not recommended and it probably won't receive new features anymore.

`Installing debug and release libraries and plugins into separate locations`_
=============================================================================

As explained in :gh:`mosra/magnum#45`, on some platforms it is not possible to
mix debug and release libraries, as it leads to linker errors. Additionally it
also wasn't possible to install both debug and release libraries into the same
location, causing various inconveniences. Since this release, debug libraries
are installed with ``-d`` suffix and debug plugins are installed into separate
``magnum-d/`` directory. From end-user point of view not much has changed,
CMake will automatically select proper libraries based on build type and also
tries the best to select appropriate plugin directory. See
:dox:`documentation about plugins <plugins>` for more information about plugin
directories on multi-configuration build systems.
