Cover image HOWTO
#################

1.  export ``cover.png`` from ``cover.svg`` (all references from it point to
    the same directory, in case something is broken)
2.  export ``cover.blend`` to ``cover.obj``
3.  load ``cover.conf`` with ``cover.obj`` in ``cover-image-generator`` and
    export the image to ``content/img/announcements/2018.02/cover.jpg``
